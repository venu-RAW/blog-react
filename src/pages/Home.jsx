				<p>
					Blog posts are great for generating search traffic, demonstrating
					your expertise in a given field, and communicating with your
					client base. A well written blog, backed with a sound strategy,
					should generate a number of potential leads for you and your
					business. Are you capturing them? If people arenâ€™t exploring your
					site for more information, you need to do a better job of turning
					your blog post pages into landing pages.
